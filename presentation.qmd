## ACS PUMS data

```{R}
#| include: false
#| cache: true
#| file: getPUMSdata.R
```


# How did we do it?  ACS data using R

## Getting started with R & Quarto

- You will need (all ***free!***):
    - an installation of the **`R`** ***statistical software system***
        - We'll need to install a few ***packages*** in the slides that follow

    - an ***IDE***
        - I recommend Microsoft's **Visual Studio Code** but **RStudio** works well too
        - If using Visual Studio Code, install the **`R` extension for Visual Studio Code**

    - an installation of the ***publishing system*** **Quarto**
        - Quarto will request that you install **`TinyTex`**
        - If using Visual Studio Code, install the **Quarto extension**
    
    - *Recommended*: **Git** ***version control system*** and **GitHub** account
